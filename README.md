# Banjeer - Microsoft Imagine Cup

Welcome to the **Banjeer** project repository! We created Banjeer as a response to the recurring floods in Jakarta, which have been an issue since the 17th century.

## Overview

Jakarta faces annual floods, exacerbated by climate change. Banjeer utilizes Computer Vision to monitor river conditions using satellite images, aiming to help stakeholders with flood mitigation, preparation, and response.

Our automated river condition detection system aids the government in reducing capital, time, and human resources spent on flood countermeasures. In addition, our web platform includes features to raise environmental awareness among Jakarta's citizens.

Our short-term goal is to improve flood mitigation, preparation, and response, while our long-term goal is to completely stop Jakarta's annual floods. We hope to eventually expand our product to help respond to floods worldwide, particularly in developing nations.

**Let the River Flow!**
